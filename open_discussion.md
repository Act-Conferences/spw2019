# Swiss Perl Workshop Open Discussion

August 17th, Olten, Switzerland


## Future name? Weâ€™re not just Perl anymore

Swiss Perl and Friends?

The Swiss Perl and Raku Workshop? (projects and research)

PHARW - Perl Helvetia and Raku Workshop

perl6 naming is not settled yet, so any future name will be influenced by this

Speak to Barcelona.pm about their experiences

Olten Opensource Meetup (see Limerick)

Use the word development / programming in the title

History repeating (TPC -> OSCON)

Open vs community event

Central European Perl Community Meetup

## Collaboration with other [Perl] events?

Keep Perl/Raku scope, invite another language community
	- to start with
	- a handful of talks from other language community
	- guest speakers / guest workshops
	- half day docker + perl/raku workshop

We need an open calendar - avoiding clashing

github repo for this?

longer term perspective, planner further ahead

software craftsmanship groups

Another Alpine Perl/Raku Workshop?
	- not necessarily Swiss/Austria
	- France, Italy, Germany, Liechtenstein, and farther?

## Venue/Dates

continuity on dates/venue?

## Talks / Schedule

More marketing, mailing lists, blogs, newsletters

## Future schedule - single day? (Workshops struggling to fill schedule, even conferences)

Single day on a Saturday, two tracks if enough talks - would attendees travel for a single day?

Have a second day that is a hackathon / sprint / discussion / workshops
	- half a maker day
		+ (mini maker fair Zurich, no longer runs)
		+ other mini maker fairs used to run
		+ maker fair brand
	- might address the not traveling issue

Keep the programming scope

Would this affect the social aspect?

If two days balance the schedule better

If only on Saturday would have to charge to get the commitment.

More workshops, hands on things - would encourage companies to send employees(?)
	- morning workshops, afternoon talks?
	- prep, early announcements

## Future venues?

Hack spaces?

Most (?) don't have much space?

Zurich hack space

What do we really need (equipment/facilities)

Universities / technical schools

## Involve students?

mini seminars

makers

software craftsmanship groups - more about concepts than specific languages

conceptual direction?
